<h1>The Best Movies According to Rebecca</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p> 
    This movie is a timeless classic and was pivitol in the foundation
    of my humor growing up. Arguably the most quotable movie of all time.
</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
    One of the greatest space movies of all time. Christopher Nolan
    made it feel like you were actually on the adventure with the characters.
    I saw this in theaters three times. Also, this soundtrack slaps.

<h3>Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse</h3>
<p>
    The way this movie integrated a classic comic book art style into 
    the storytelling made me giddy. The colors, the action, all of it. 
    Miles Morales is also my favorite Spider-Man.
